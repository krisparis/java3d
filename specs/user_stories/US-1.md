# User Story 1

## Name:
Physics engine


## Description:
**As** a gamer 

**I want to** have a physics engine that can compute a ball trajectory in a three dimensional space :

- during a free fall
- after a throw with initial velocity
- after a rebond on a surface. 
- taking into account the friction force on a surface
- taking into account the angular velocity of the ball


**So that** the 3d game will use the implemented engine for simulating realistic ball motion.
 

## Acceptance criteria:
